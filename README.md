#### A screen mount for the Raspberry Pi 400  

A non-destructive 3d-printed mount for the Raspberry Pi 400. Uses a single M3 screw to secure to the PI400 via the Kensingon lock opening.  

I'm waiting for 7" display with built in speakers (and touch) - Elecrow RC070S. I am currently using a generic 5"  
An Angled Micro HDMI to HDMI with FPV ribbon cable would work nicely - [Similar to this, but shorter](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Degrees-Angled-Multicopter-Aerial-Photography/dp/B072PVG4B4)  


#### BOM:  
Mount:  
3x M3 screws, between 16 and 25 mm    ~€1  
2x M3 locking nut                     ~€1  
1x M3 thread cutting tool (optional)  ~€3
Display and connections:  
1x Display                            ~€80  
1x Micro HDMI to HDMI cable           ~€10  
1x Power                              ~€1  

#### Print instructions:  
Fill walls up to 2 mm, or the tab in the GPIO end will break. Alternatively, print it 100% solid.  
Note that the screen frame is TEMPORARY, and you can make one suitable for your needs. I will make a proper screen frame once I have my target display.  
Cut a suitable 3mm thread for the screw in the hole going into the Kensington lock hole, AND in all of the hinge holes.
